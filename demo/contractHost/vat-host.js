 * @fileoverview Simple AMD module exports a {@code makeContractHost}

 * contract. Requires SES and its simple AMD loader.

/**
 * A contract host as a mutually trusted third party for honestly
 * running whatever smart contract code its customers agree on.
 *
 * <p>When mutually suspicious parties wish to engage in a joint
 * contract, if they can agree on a contract host to be run the
 * following code honestly, agree on the code that represents their
 * smart contract, and agree on which side of the contract they each
 * play, then they can validly engage in the contract.
 *
 * <p>The {@code contractSrc} is assumed to be the source code for a
 * closed SES function, where each of the parties to the contract is
 * supposed to provide their respective fulfilled arguments. Once
 * all these arguments are fulfilled, then the contract is run.
 *
 * <p>There are two "roles" for participating in the protocol:
 * contract initiator, who calls the contract host's {@code setup}
 * method, and contract participants, who call the contract host's
 * {@code play} method. For example, let's say the contract in
 * question is the board manager for playing chess. The initiator
 * instantiates a new chess game, whose board manager is a two
 * argument function, where argument zero is provided by the player
 * playing "white" and argument one is provided by the player
 * playing "black".
 *
 * <p>The {@code setup} method returns an array of tokens, one per
 * argument, where each token represents the exclusive right to
 * provide that argument. The initiator would then distribute these
 * tokens to each of the players, together with the alleged source
 * for the game they would be playing, and their alleged side, i.e.,
 * which argument position they are responsible for providing.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   // Contract initiator
 *   var tokensP = Q(contractHostP).invoke('setup', chessSrc);
 *   var whiteTokenP = Q(tokensP).get(0);
 *   var blackTokenP = Q(tokensP).get(1);
 *   Q(whitePlayer).invoke('invite', whiteTokenP, chessSrc, 0);
 *   Q(blackPlayer).invoke('invite', blackTokenP, chessSrc, 1);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Each player, on receiving the token, alleged game source, and
 * alleged argument index, would first decide (e.g., with the {@code
 * check} function below) whether this is a game they would be
 * interested in playing. If so, the redeem the token to
 * start playing their side of the game -- but only if the contract
 * host verifies that they are playing the side of the game that
 * they think they are.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   // Contract participant
 *   function invite(tokenP, allegedChessSrc, allegedSide) {
 *     check(allegedChessSrc, allegedSide);
 *     var outcomeP = Q(contractHostP).invoke(
 *         'play', tokenP, allegedChessSrc, allegedSide, arg);
 *   }
 * </pre>

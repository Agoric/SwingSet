/**
 * A Timer device that provides a capability that can be used to schedule wake()
 * calls at particular times. The simpler form is an object w with a wake()
 * function can be passed to D(timer).setWakeup(300, w) to be woken after 5
 * minutes. The other form allows one to create a repeater object with
 * r = D(timer).createRepeater(120, 3600) which can be scheduled hourly starting
 * in two minutes. Each time r.schedule(w) is called, w.wake(r) will be
 * scheduled to be called after the next multiple of an hour since the initial
 * time. This doesn't guarantee that the wake() calls will come at the right
 * time, but repeated scheduling will not accumulate drift.
 *
 * The main entry point is setup. The other exports are for testing.
 * setup(...) calls makeDeviceSlots(..., makeRootDevice, ...), which calls
 * deviceSlots' build() function (which invokes makeRootDevice) to create the
 * root device. Selected vats that need to schedule events can be given access
 * to the device.
 *
 * This code runs in the inner half of the device vat. It handles kernel objects
 * in serialized format, and uses SO() to send messages to them.

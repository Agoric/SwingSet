// Deep stack debugging

// This module is used for diagnostic purposes, and keeps a bunch of
// mutable top-level state in violation of normal best
// practices. Because this state is used *only* for diagnostic
// purposes, we indulge. Ideally, we should support a special
// write-only diagnostics category of rule-violating code just as we
// do for test code. The key is that unprivileged clients cannot
// communicate with each other via such APIs. They can only
// communicate to those with special ability to read this diagnostic
// channel. "console" already fits these constraints and should be
// codified as precedent.

// If 0, calling this module's exports should be essentially
// free. Otherwise, calling these exports will silently do internal
// bookkeeping until logReceive catches an error. At that point, it
// will also emit deep stacks to console.log.
//
// Because we accumulate both send records and receive records, this
// should be approximately twice the number of shallow stacks needed.
